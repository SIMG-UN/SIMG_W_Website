## 🚀 SIMG Weekly Research Sync

**Semillero de Investigación en Modelos Generativos (SIMG)**
Pioneers in Hard Tech AI from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

## 📅 Meeting Details

- **Frequency:** Every Friday
- **Time:** 7:00 PM — 9:00 PM (GMT-5)
- **Modality:** Virtual — [Join on Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/nhh-dfrp-iuu)
- **Audience:** UNAL students, researchers, and Latin American developers interested in the technical frontier of AI.

## 🧠 Session Agenda

Our meetings are divided into three high-impact critical blocks:

**SOTA Deep Dive (45 min):** Rigorous analysis of last week's papers. We don't just read the conclusions — we break down the math and architecture (Diffusion Models, Geometry of Information, Topology).

**Engineering & Optimization (45 min):** Technical discussion on implementation. From NVIDIA CUDA kernels and massive parallelism to efficient architectures for health and finance (PHIN GPT).

**Project Roadmap & Lab Sync (30 min):** Tracking ongoing goals, infrastructure management on Vercel/Hugging Face, and coordination of upcoming scientific publications.

## 🛠️ Participant Profile

We are looking for restless minds who want to go beyond using APIs. If you are passionate about:

- Applied mathematics for neural networks
- GPU and low-level processing
- Building technological sovereignty in Spanish

> **Note:** You don't need to be an expert to join as an Explorer, but you must have the willingness to learn and write real code.

## Building LATAM's Technical AI Future

![LATAM AI collaboration map](/images/website/LATAM-ai.png)

At SIMG, we're committed to demonstrating that world-class AI projects are not only possible, but economically viable from Latin America. Our collaboration with **Jhenner Tigreros**, a technical expert in CUDA and GPU computing from Colombia, exemplifies this commitment to regional technical excellence.

## The Reality of Costs: DeepSeek-R1

In a recent update to the **DeepSeek-R1** paper, the time and money spent on complete training was finally confirmed:

### Real Cost Analysis

- **💰 Training Cost**: $294,000 USD
- **👥 Estimated Technical Team**: 50 people
- **⏱️ Development Time**: ~1 year
- **📊 Estimated Total Cost**: ~$6,000,000 USD (including payroll)

**The truth**: A trivial amount compared to Silicon Valley projects that typically exceed $100M USD.

### Our Response

> **With these numbers, it's clear that quality and valuable projects can be developed from LATAM.**
>
> With technical teams from universities willing to act **not from the ego of being first**, but from the excitement of **doing it right from the beginning as a region**.
>
> **Never stop learning** 🚀

## Collaboration with Jhenner Tigreros

### Technical Focus

Our collaboration with Jhenner focuses on critical areas of AI infrastructure:

#### 1. **CUDA Optimization**
- Development of efficient CUDA kernels for generative model operations
- GPU memory optimization and resource management
- Parallelization techniques to maximize available hardware

#### 2. **Low-Level Architecture**
- Implementation of optimized mathematical operations
- Performance profiling and analysis
- Integration with modern frameworks (PyTorch, JAX)

#### 3. **Algorithmic Efficiency**
- Computational complexity reduction
- Quantization and compression strategies
- Distributed training techniques

### Why It Matters

Jhenner's expertise in CUDA and GPU computing represents the type of deep technical knowledge LATAM needs to develop:

- **Technological Sovereignty**: We don't exclusively depend on external solutions
- **Local Knowledge**: We build technical capabilities in the region
- **Efficiency**: We maximize the use of limited resources
- **Innovation**: We create solutions adapted to our context

## The LATAM Case

### Why Now?

The DeepSeek-R1 numbers validate what we've been saying:

1. **💡 It's not just about scale**: Algorithmic efficiency and mathematical rigor surpass simple "more compute"
2. **🎓 We have the talent**: Latin American universities produce world-class researchers and engineers
3. **💰 It's financially viable**: $6M USD is achievable with mixed funding (academia + industry + government)
4. **🌎 There's regional demand**: Models adapted to Latin American context have unique value

### LATAM's Competitive Advantages

#### Technical Talent
- Recognized universities with strong mathematics and CS programs
- Culture of "doing more with less" that fosters efficiency
- Bilingualism (Spanish/English) that facilitates international collaboration

#### Operational Costs
- Competitive salaries without sacrificing quality
- Accessible cloud infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Potential to optimize costs without compromising results

#### Cultural Context
- Deep understanding of Spanish-speaking markets
- Access to unique regional data and use cases
- Temporal proximity to the United States for collaborations

## Vision: LATAM Technical Ecosystem

### 2026-2027 Goals

1. **🔬 Demonstrative Projects**
   - Train SOTA model in specific domain with limited budget
   - Publish benchmarks and open-source code
   - Document process and real costs

2. **👥 Community Building**
   - Form network of CUDA and GPU computing experts
   - Organize technical workshops and hackathons
   - Create educational resources in Spanish

3. **🏗️ Shared Infrastructure**
   - Negotiate access to compute resources for research
   - Develop open-source tools for optimization
   - Establish regional standards and best practices

4. **🤝 Strategic Collaborations**
   - Connect academia with local tech industry
   - Seek funding from foundations and government
   - Participate in international initiatives from LATAM
